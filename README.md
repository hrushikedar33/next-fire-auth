### Why Next Fire Auth

Starting a new project that involves using Firebase for authentication can be time-consuming and tedious, as it requires setting up various features and functionality such as **routes, protected routes, login and register components, styling, and form validation**. These tasks can be particularly frustrating if they need to be set up from scratch **every time** a new project is started.

Here is **Next-Fire-Auth** template for you.

I have used latest NextJs version 13, with latest routing method and focus on Server Components. You will find all pages in `/app/` directory

### Technologies used

1. [Next v13](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/)
1. [Firebase v9](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/modular-upgrade)
1. [Tailwind CSS v3](https://tailwindcss.com/)
1. [Reactjs v18](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
1. [Typescipt](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
1. [React-Firebase-Hooks](https://github.com/csfrequency/react-firebase-hooks)

### Features

1. Email Password Authetication & Google Authetication
1. Forgot Password Feature
1. Login & SignUp forms validations
1. NextJs 13 routing

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hrushikedar33/next-fire-auth my-project
yarn
```

> Make sure you replace **my-project** with your own project name

<details><summary>If you don't have yarn installed</summary>
<p>

```bash
npm i
```

> Remove **yarn.lock** as you will already have **package.lock**

</p>
</details>

1. Go to Firebase console. Add Project. In project overview, click on the web icon and register the app. You will see `firebaseConfig object`, We will require its details further. Click on Authetication, then on set up sign-in method. Enable `Email/password authentication` & `google authentication`.
1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project's root. Example of `.env.local` file is given below. Make sure you replace `YOUR_FIREBASE_CONSOLE_DETAILS` with your `firebaseConfig object` details.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_CONSOLE_DETAILS
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_CONSOLE_DETAILS
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_CONSOLE_DETAILS
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_CONSOLE_DETAILS
NEXT_PUBLIC_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_CONSOLE_DETAILS
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_CONSOLE_DETAILS
```

3. That's It ! Finally run the application

```
yarn dev # OR npm run dev
```
